# Pomodoro Timer
This project was built in less than 30 minutes as a tool to help me study better - as it's very easy for me to procrastinate... Read more about the Pomodoro Technique [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

If the program looks blurry when you open it, simply follow these instructions:  
`Right Click 'Pomodoro' -> Properties -> Compatibility -> Check 'Disable display scaling on high DPI settings' -> OK`

## How to Use

The GUI is self-explanatory - there is a play, pause and reset button as required. The time remaining is shown on the label on the top left, and a progress bar indicates how much time has elapsed.

**src** - contains source files  
**release** - contains executable .exe

### Why Visual Basic?
1. Drag and Drop GUI - quick designing
2. Doesn't hog as much memory like a JVM would
3. It gets the job done and takes the least time to program
